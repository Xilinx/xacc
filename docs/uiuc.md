# University of Illinois at Urbana Champagne

The Xilinx center of excellence at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign [UIUC](https://csl.illinois.edu/news/illinois-named-xilinx-center-excellence), is directed by CSL Professor [Deming Chen](http://dchen.ece.illinois.edu/), the Abel Bliss Professor of Engineering, and is home to the UIUC Heterogeneous Accelerated Compute Cluster.

The center mission is to investigate and propose system solutions for high-performance computing (HPC), distributed computing, machine learning (ML) and other computation intensive applications, as well as programming models, compilers, and schedulers, for the Xilinx Alveo and Versal devices. 

The goal is to create new opportunities in data center and HPC domains, with a focus on increasing the flexibility of the memory hierarchy and exploiting parallelism at a large scale.

### The HACC Cluster

The cluster is hosted within the Coordinated Science Lab at UIUC. The cluster is accessible to other researchers whose interest align with the cluster mission. Currently, there are two other institutions, [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/eng/profile/martin-herbordt/) and [Northeastern University](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/leeser-miriam/), are using the cluster.

It is comprised of 6 compute nodes + 4 Support nodes.

- 1 x Head node – Many core, large memory development node.
- 2 x Compute nodes – Accelerated compute node
- 2 x Big compute nodes – Accelerated compute nodes with support for up to eight accelerators per node
- 1 x Big Data node – FPGA + high end GPU node for big data analytics research
- 4 x Login nodes
