# Training

This page presents a list of resources to get you started with the different AMD tools to carry out your research successfully.

- [AMD University Program Vitis Tutorial](https://xilinx.github.io/xup_compute_acceleration/) it is a really good place to start. It includes both video presentations and hands-on experience with Vitis.

AMD provides commercial training courses on a wide range of topics. Find the latest courses on the [AMD training webpage](https://www.xilinx.com/training/customer-training.html)

### Productive Parallel Programming for FPGA with HLS

Johannes de Fine Licht and Torsten Hoefler from SPCL at ETH Zurich offer this HPC-oriented tutorial that shows how high-level synthesis (HLS) can be harnessed to productively achieve scalable pipeline parallelism on FPGAs. Using familiar codes known from software, it is shown how FPGA resources are targeted from high-level C++ code, guiding the mapping from imperative code to hardware to enable massively parallel designs.

You can find out more information in [this link](https://spcl.inf.ethz.ch/Teaching/hls-tutorial/) and [watch the presentation here](https://youtu.be/2UvUP2hxMyI).

## Books

This following books may also be relevant in the context of HACC and compute acceleration in general

1. [Parallel Programming for FPGAs Book](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.03648.pdf) by Ryan Kastner, Janarbek Matai, and Stephen Neuendorffer. Covers HLS and parallel hardware concepts.  
   [Source code on GitHub](https://github.com/KastnerRG/pp4fpgas) [Projects and Labs](https://pp4fpgas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
1. [The ZYNQ Book](http://www.zynqbook.com/), the earlier chapters of the book cover basic HLS concepts, such as pipeline and dataflow which may be relevant for researchers developing accelerators.
