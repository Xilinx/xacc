# ETH Zurich

The cluster at ETH Zurich provides the infrastructure to research in systems, architecture and applications.

The head of the ETH Zurich HACC is [Prof. Gustavo Alonso](https://inf.ethz.ch/people/person-detail.alonso.html) from the [Systems Group](https://systems.ethz.ch/) in the  Department of Computer Science at ETH Zurich.
