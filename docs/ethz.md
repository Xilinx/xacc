# ETH Zurich

The cluster at ETH Zurich provides the infrastructure to research in systems, architecture and applications.

The head of the ETH Zurich HACC is [Prof. Gustavo Alonso](https://inf.ethz.ch/people/person-detail.alonso.html) from the [Systems Group](https://systems.ethz.ch/) in the  Department of Computer Science at ETH Zurich.  

## Infrastructure

The ETH Zurich cluster consists of fifteen servers one for development and fourteen for deployment. Four deployment servers host a mix of [Alveo U250](https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/alveo/u250.html) and [Alveo U280](https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/alveo/u280.html), whereas, the other ten servers host [Alveo U55C](https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/alveo/u55c.html) as shown in the image below

In terms of networking communication, each Alveo cards has two 100 Gbps interfaces, both of them are connected to a switch

> Note: hardware and network configuration can change at any time

Once you are approved for the HACC program, details on how to access the ETH Zurich HACC and the other HACCs can be found on the [HACC members site](https://www.xilinx.com/member/xup_research_clusters.html).

For more information on the hardware configuration and software, see the [ETH Zurich HACC](https://systems.ethz.ch/research/data-processing-on-modern-hardware/hacc.html) webpage.
