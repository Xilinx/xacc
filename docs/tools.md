# Tools

This page covers software that may be used for developing accelerators for the HACCs. Some of these tools may be available on the HACCs. You can set these tools up locally on your own computer and carry out development work on your own computer. If you have any questions about software tools related to the HACC, or need any academic licenses, please e-mail the AMD University Program <xup@amd.com>.

## Download Software

1. [AMD design tools](https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools.html).

   Vitis is the recommended software development flow for use with the HACCs, and is available for free from the AMD website.

1. [Installing Deployment/Development Software](https://www.xilinx.com/support/download/index.html/content/xilinx/en/downloadNav/alveo.html) for the board you will use.

It is recommended to use the XRT version corresponding to a Vitis version, and to try and match the same version that is installed on the HACC. Note that there are separate files for development and deployment shells. You should install the development shell on your own computer.
