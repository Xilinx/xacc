# Tools

This page covers software that may be used for developing accelerators for the HACCs. Some of these tools may be available on the HACCs. You can set these tools up locally on your own computer and carry out development work on your own computer. If you have any questions about software tools related to the HACC, or need any Xilinx academic licenses, please e-mail the [Xilinx University Program](https://www.xilinx.com/xup) <xup@xilinx.com>.

## Download Software

1. [Download Vitis Unified Software](https://www.xilinx.com/support/download/index.html/content/xilinx/en/downloadNav/vitis.html) or [Vitis HLS](https://docs.xilinx.com/r/en-US/ug1399-vitis-hls).

   Vitis is the recommended software development flow for use with the HACCs, and is available for free from the Xilinx website.

1. [Installing Deployment/Development Software](https://www.xilinx.com/html_docs/accelerator_cards/alveo_doc_280/rqs1535740612656.html).

It is recommended to use the XRT version corresponding to a Vitis version, and to try and match the same version that is installed on the HACC. Note that there are separate files for development and deployment shells. You should install the development shell on your own computer.
