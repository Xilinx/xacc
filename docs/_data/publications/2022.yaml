    The single-source shortest path (SSSP) problem is one of the most important and well-studied graph problems widely used in many application domains, such as road navigation, neural image reconstruction, and social network analysis. Although we have known various SSSP algorithms for decades, implementing one for large scale power-law graphs efficiently is still highly challenging today, because ① a work-efficient SSSP algorithm requires priority-order traversal of graph data, ② the priority queue needs to be scalable both in throughput and capacity, and ③ priority-order traversal requires extensive random memory accesses on graph data. In this paper, we present SPLAG to accelerate SSSP for powerlaw graphs on FPGAs. SPLAG uses a coarse-grained priority queue (CGPQ) to enable high-throughput priority-order graph traversal with a large frontier. To mitigate the high-volume random accesses, SPLAG employs a customized vertex cache (CVC) to reduce off-chip memory access and improve the throughput to read and update vertex data. Experimental results on various synthetic and real world datasets show up to a 4.9× speedup over state-of-the-art SSSP accelerators, a 2.6× speedup over 32-thread CPU running at 4.4 GHz, and a 0.9× speedup over an A100 GPU that has 4.1× power budget and 3.4× HBM bandwidth. Such a high performance would place SPLAG in the 14th position of the Graph 500 benchmark for data intensive applications (the highest using a single FPGA) with only a 45 W power budget. SPLAG is written in high-level synthesis C++ and is fully parameterized, which means it can be easily ported to various different FPGAs with different configurations.

    Adopting FPGA as an accelerator in datacenters is becoming mainstream for customized computing, but the fact that FPGAs are hard to program creates a steep learning curve for software programmers. Even with the help of high-level synthesis (HLS), accelerator designers still have to manually perform code reconstruction and cumbersome parameter tuning to achieve optimal performance. While many learning models have been leveraged by existing work to automate the design of efficient accelerators, the unpredictability of modern HLS tools becomes a major obstacle for them to maintain high accuracy. To address this problem, we propose an automated DSE framework—AutoDSE—that leverages a bottleneck-guided coordinate optimizer to systematically find a better design point. AutoDSE detects the bottleneck of the design in each step and focuses on high-impact parameters to overcome it. The experimental results show that AutoDSE is able to identify the design point that achieves, on the geometric mean, 19.9× speedup over one CPU core for MachSuite and Rodinia benchmarks. Compared to the manually optimized HLS vision kernels in Xilinx Vitis libraries, AutoDSE can reduce their optimization pragmas by 26.38× while achieving similar performance. With less than one optimization pragma per design on average, we are making progress towards democratizing customizable computing by enabling software programmers to design efficient FPGA accelerators.

    Using High-Level Synthesis (HLS), the hardware designers must describe only a high-level behavioral flow of the design. However, it still can take weeks to develop a high-performance architecture mainly because there are many design choices at a higher level to explore. Besides, it takes several minutes to hours to evaluate the design with the HLS tool. To solve this problem, we model the HLS tool with a graph neural network that is trained to be used for a wide range of applications. The experimental results demonstrate that our model can estimate the quality of design in milliseconds with high accuracy, resulting in up to 79X speedup (with an average of 48X) for optimizing the design compared to the previous state-of-the-art work relying on the HLS tool.

  abstract: |
    Hybrid computing platforms, comprising CPU cores and FPGA logic, are increasingly used for accelerating data-intensive workloads in cloud deployments, and are a growing topic of interest in systems research. However, from a research perspective, existing hardware platforms are limited: they are often optimized for concrete, narrow use-cases and, therefore lack the flexibility needed to explore other applications and configurations. We show that a research group can design and build a more general, open, and affordable hardware platform for hybrid systems research. The platform, Enzian, is capable of duplicating the functionality of existing CPU/FPGA systems with comparable performance but in an open, flexible system. It couples a large FPGA with a server-class CPU in an asymmetric cache-coherent NUMA system. Enzian also enables research not possible with existing hybrid platforms, through explicit access to coherence messages, extensive thermal and power instrumentation, and an open, programmable baseboard management processor. Enzian is already being used in multiple projects, is open source (both hardware and software), and available for remote use. We present the design principles of Enzian, the challenges in building it, and evaluate it with a range of existing research use-cases alongside other, more specialized platforms, as well as demonstrating research not possible on existing platforms.

  abstract: |
    Cloud deployments disaggregate storage from compute, providing more flexibility to both the storage and compute layers. In this paper, we explore disaggregation by taking it one step further and applying it to memory (DRAM). Disaggregated memory uses network attached DRAM as a way to decouple memory from CPU. In the context of databases, such a design offers significant advantages in terms of making a larger memory capacity available as a central pool to a collection of smaller processing nodes. To explore these possibilities, we have implemented Farview, a disaggregated memory solution for databases, operating as a remote buffer cache with operator offloading capabilities. Farview is implemented as an FPGA-based smart NIC making DRAM available as a disaggregated, network attached memory pool capable of performing data processing at line rate over data streams to/from disaggregated memory. Farview supports query offloading using operators such as selection, projection, aggregation, regular expression matching and encryption. In this paper we focus on analytical queries and demonstrate the viability of the idea through an extensive experimental evaluation of Farview under different workloads. Farview is competitive with a local buffer cache solution for all the workloads and outperforms it in a number of cases, proving that a smart disaggregated memory can be a viable alternative for databases deployed in cloud environments.

  abstract: |
    With reduced data reuse and parallelism, recent convolutional neural networks (CNNs) create new challenges for FPGA acceleration. Systolic arrays (SAs) are efficient, scalable architectures for convolutional layers, but without proper optimizations, their efficiency drops dramatically for reasons: (1) the different dimensions within same-type layers, (2) the different convolution layers especially transposed and dilated convolutions, and (3) CNN’s complex dataflow graph. Furthermore, significant overheads arise when integrating FPGAs into machine learning frameworks. Therefore, we present a flexible, composable architecture called FlexCNN, which delivers high computation efficiency by employing dynamic tiling, layer fusion, and data layout optimizations. Additionally, we implement a novel versatile SA to process normal, transposed, and dilated convolutions efficiently. FlexCNN also uses a fully pipelined software-hardware integration that alleviates the software overheads. Moreover, with an automated compilation flow, FlexCNN takes a CNN in the ONNX representation, performs a design space exploration, and generates an FPGA accelerator. The framework is tested using three complex CNNs: OpenPose, U-Net, and E-Net. The architecture optimizations achieve 2.3× performance improvement. Compared to a standard SA, the versatile SA achieves close-to-ideal speedups, with up to 5.98× and 13.42× for transposed and dilated convolutions, with a 6% average area overhead. The pipelined integration leads to a 5× speedup for OpenPose.

  abstract: |
    Pre-alignment filters are useful for reducing the computational requirements of genomic sequence mappers. Most of them are based on estimating or computing the edit distance between sequences and their candidate locations in a reference genome using a subset of the dynamic programming table used to compute Levenshtein distance. Some of their FPGA implementations of use classic HDL toolchains, thus limiting their portability. Currently, most FPGA accelerators offered by heterogeneous cloud providers support C/C++ HLS. This work implements and optimizes several state-of-the-art pre-alignment filters using C/C++ based-HLS to expand their portability to a wide range of systems supporting the OpenCL runtime. A complete analysis of the performance and accuracy is performed. The maximum throughput obtained by an exact filter is 95.1 MPairs/s including memory transfers using 100 bp sequences, which is the highest ever reported for a comparable system and more than two times faster than previous HDL-based results. The best energy efficiency obtained from the accelerator (not considering host CPU) is 2.1 MPairs/J, more than one order of magnitude higher than other accelerator-based comparable approaches from the state of the art.

  abstract: |
    Probabilistic Sentential Decision Diagrams (PSDDs) provide efficient methods for modeling and reasoning with probability distributions in the presence of massive logical constraints. PSDDs can also be synthesized from graphical models such as Bayesian networks (BNs) therefore offering a new set of tools for performing inference on these models (in time linear in the PSDD size). Despite these favorable characteristics of PSDDs, we have found multiple challenges in PSDD’s FPGA acceleration. Problems include limited parallelism, data dependency, and small pipeline iterations. In this article, we propose several optimization techniques to solve these issues with novel pipeline scheduling and parallelization schemes. We designed the PSDD kernel with a high-level synthesis (HLS) tool for ease of implementation and verified it on the Xilinx Alveo U250 board. Experimental results show that our methods improve the baseline FPGA HLS implementation performance by 2,200X and the multicore CPU implementation by 20X. The proposed design also outperforms state-of-the-art BN and Sum Product Network (SPN) accelerators that store the graph information in memory.

    The year 2011 marked an important transition for FPGA high-level synthesis (HLS), as it went from prototyping to deployment. A decade later, in this article, we assess the progress of the deployment of HLS technology and highlight the successes in several application domains, including deep learning, video transcoding, graph processing, and genome sequencing. We also discuss the challenges faced by today’s HLS technology and the opportunities for further research and development, especially in the areas of achieving high clock frequency, coping with complex pragmas and system integration, legacy code transformation, building on open source HLS infrastructures, supporting domain-specific languages, and standardization. It is our hope that this article will inspire more research on FPGA HLS and bring it to a new height.

  abstract: |
    The block minifloat (BM) number format uses an 8-bit floating point format with additional shared exponent bias to enable low-precision representation with large dynamic range. While it has been shown that the BM format can support low-precision training of convolutional neural networks such as ResNet on ImageNet at precisions down to 6 bits, its applicability to inference-only applications has not been studied. We present a BM implementation of N-BEATS, a deep neural architecture for univariate time series forecasting. N-BEATS utilises residual and fully connected (FC) blocks to achieve high accuracy. It was found that 8-bit BM had similar area and speed as 8-bit integer arithmetic with NBEATS accuracy similar to 16-bit floating point.

  abstract: |
    Fully Homomorphic Encryption is a technique that allows computation on encrypted data. It has the potential to drastically change privacy considerations in the cloud, but high computational and memory overheads are preventing its broad adoption. TFHE is a promising Torus-based FHE scheme that heavily relies on bootstrapping, the noise-removal tool that must be invoked after every encrypted gate computation. We present FPT, a Fixed-Point FPGA accelerator for TFHE bootstrapping. FPT is the first hardware accelerator to heavily exploit the inherent noise present in FHE calculations. Instead of double or single-precision floating-point arithmetic, it implements TFHE bootstrapping entirely with approximate fixed-point arithmetic. Using an in-depth analysis of noise propagation in bootstrapping FFT computations, FPT is able to use noise-trimmed fixed-point representations that are up to 50% smaller than prior implementations using floating-point or integer FFTs. FPT's microarchitecture is built as a streaming processor inspired by traditional streaming DSPs: it instantiates high-throughput computational stages that are directly cascaded, with simplified control logic and routing networks. We explore different throughput-balanced compositions of streaming kernels with a user-configurable streaming width in order to construct a full bootstrapping pipeline. FPT's streaming approach allows 100% utilization of arithmetic units and requires only small bootstrapping key caches, enabling an entirely compute-bound bootstrapping throughput of 1 BS / 35 us. This is in stark contrast to the established classical CPU approach to FHE bootstrapping acceleration, which tends to be heavily memory and bandwidth-constrained. FPT is fully implemented and evaluated as a bootstrapping FPGA kernel for an Alveo U280 datacenter accelerator card. FPT achieves almost three orders of magnitude higher bootstrapping throughput than existing CPU-based implementations, and 2.5x higher throughput compared to recent ASIC emulation experiments.

  abstract: |
    FPGAs have been proven to be powerful computational accelerators across many types of workloads. The mainstream programming approach is high level synthesis (HLS), which maps high-level languages (e.g. C+ #pragmas) to hardware. Unfortunately, HLS leaves a significant programmability gap in terms of reconfigurability, customization and versatility: Although HLS compilation is fast, the downstream physical design takes hours to days; FPGA reconfiguration time limits the time-multiplexing ability of hardware, and tools do not reason about cross-workload flexibility. Overlay architectures mitigate the above by mapping a programmable design (e.g. CPU, GPU, etc.) on top of FPGAs. However, the abstraction gap between overlay and FPGA leads to low efficiency/utilization. Our essential idea is to develop a hardware generation framework targeting a highly-customizable overlay, so that the abstraction gap can be lowered by tuning the design instance to applications of interest. We leverage and extend prior work on customizable spatial architectures, SoC generation, accelerator compilers, and design space explorers to create an end-to-end FPGA acceleration system. Our novel techniques address inefficient networks between on-chip memories and processing elements, as well as improving DSE by reducing the amount of recompilation required. Our framework, OverGen, is highly competitive with fixed-function HLS-based designs, even though the generated designs are programmable with fast reconfiguration. We compared to a state-of-the-art DSE-based HLS framework, AutoDSE. Without kernel-tuning for AutoDSE, OverGen gets 1.2× geomean performance, and even with manual kernel-tuning for the baseline, OverGen still gets 0.55× geomean performance--all while providing runtime flexibility across workloads.

    Customized accelerators provide gains of performance and efficiency in specific domains of applications. Sparse data structures and/or representations exist in a wide range of applications. However, it is challenging to design accelerators for sparse applications because no architecture or performance-level analytic models are able to fully capture the spectrum of the sparse data. Accelerator researchers rely on real execution to get precise feedback for their designs. In this work, we present PYXIS, a performance dataset for customized accelerators on sparse data. PYXIS collects accelerator designs and real execution performance statistics. Currently, there are 73.8 K instances in PYXIS. PYXIS is open-source, and we are constantly growing PYXIS with new accelerator designs and performance statistics. PYXIS can be a benefit to researchers in the fields of accelerator, architecture, performance, algorithm and many related topics.

  abstract: |
    FPGAs require a much longer compilation cycle than conventional computing platforms like CPUs. In this paper, we shorten the overall compilation time by co-optimizing the HLS compilation (C-to-RTL) and the back-end physical implementation (RTL-to-bitstream). We propose a split compilation approach based on the pipelining flexibility at the HLS level, which allows us to partition designs for parallel placement and routing then stitch the separate partitions together. We outline a number of technical challenges and address them by breaking the conventional boundaries between different stages of the traditional FPGA tool flow and reorganizing them to achieve a fast end-to-end compilation. Our research produces RapidStream, a parallelized and physicalintegrated compilation framework that takes in an HLS dataflow program in C/C++ and generates a fully placed and routed implementation. When tested on the Xilinx U250 FPGA with a set of realistic HLS designs, RapidStream achieves a 5-7× reduction in compile time and up to 1.3× increase in frequency when compared to a commercial-off-the-shelf toolchain. In addition, we provide preliminary results using a customized open-source router to reduce the compile time up to an order of magnitude in the cases with lower performance requirements.

    Proposes a resource-efficient heterogeneous pipeline architecture. This heterogeneous architecture comprises of two types of pipelines: Little pipelines to process dense partitions with good locality and Big pipelines to process sparse partitions with the extremely poor locality. Unlike traditional monolithic pipeline designs, the heterogeneous pipelines are tailored for more specific memory access patterns, and hence are more lightweight, allowing the architecture to scale up to more effectively with limited resources. In addition, an automatic method generates the most efficient pipeline combination and balances workloads. Furthermore, ReGraph is an automated open-source framework. ReGraph outperforms state-of-the-art FPGA accelerators by up to 5.9 times in terms of performance and 12 times in terms of resource efficiency.

  abstract: | 
    Sparse matrix-vector multiplication (SpMV) multiplies a sparse matrix with a dense vector. SpMV plays a crucial role in many applications, from graph analytics to deep learning. The random memory accesses of the sparse matrix make accelerator design challenging. However, high bandwidth memory (HBM) based FPGAs are a good fit for designing accelerators for SpMV. In this paper, we present Serpens, an HBM based accelerator for general-purpose SpMV, which features memory-centric processing engines and index coalescing to support the efficient processing of arbitrary SpMVs. From the evaluation of twelve large-size matrices, Serpens is 1.91x and 1.76x better in terms of geomean throughput than the latest accelerators GraphLiLy and Sextans, respectively. We also evaluate 2,519 SuiteSparse matrices, and Serpens achieves 2.10x higher throughput than a K80 GPU. For the energy/bandwidth efficiency, Serpens is 1.71x/1.99x, 1.90x/2.69x, and 6.25x/4.06x better compared with GraphLily, Sextans, and K80, respectively. After scaling up to 24 HBM channels, Serpens achieves up to 60.55 GFLOP/s (30,204 MTEPS) and up to 3.79x over GraphLily.

    Sparse-Matrix Dense-Matrix multiplication (SpMM) is the key operator for a wide range of applications including scientific computing, graph processing, and deep learning. Architecting accelerators for SpMM is faced with three challenges – (1) the random memory accessing and unbalanced load in processing because of random distribution of elements in sparse matrices, (2) inefficient data handling of the large matrices which can not be fit on-chip, and (3) a non-general-purpose accelerator design where one accelerator can only process a fixed-size problem. In this paper, we present Sextans, an accelerator for general purpose SpMM processing. Sextans accelerator features (1) fast random access using on-chip memory, (2) streaming access to offchip large matrices, (3) PE-aware non-zero scheduling for balanced workload with an II=1 pipeline, and (4) hardware flexibility to enable prototyping the hardware once to support SpMMs of different size as a general-purpose accelerator. We leverage high bandwidth memory (HBM) for the efficient accessing of both sparse and dense matrices. In the evaluation, we present an FPGA prototype Sextans which is executable on a Xilinx U280 HBM FPGA board and a projected prototype Sextans-P with higher bandwidth competitive to V100 and more frequency optimization. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on 1,400 SpMMs on a wide range of sparse matrices including 50 matrices from SNAP and 150 from SuiteSparse. We compare Sextans with NVIDIA K80 and V100 GPUs. Sextans achieves a 2.50x geomean speedup over K80 GPU and Sextans-P achieves a 1.14x geomean speedup over V100 GPU (4.94x over K80).

  abstract: | 
    FPGAs are starting to be enhanced with High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) as a way to reduce the memory bandwidth bottleneck encountered in some applications and to give the FPGA more capacity to deal with application state. However, the performance characteristics of HBM are still not well specified, especially in the context of FPGAs. In this paper, we bridge the gap between nominal specifications and actual performance by benchmarking HBM on a state-of-the-art FPGA, i.e., a Xilinx Alveo U280 featuring a two-stack HBM subsystem. To this end, we propose Shuhai, a benchmarking tool that allows us to demystify all the underlying details of HBM on an FPGA. FPGA-based benchmarking should also provide a more accurate picture of HBM than doing so on CPUs/GPUs, since CPUs/GPUs are noisier systems due to their complex control logic and cache hierarchy. Since the memory itself is complex, leveraging custom hardware logic to benchmark inside an FPGA provides more details as well as accurate and deterministic measurements. We observe that 1) HBM is able to provide up to 425 GB/s memory bandwidth, and 2) how HBM is used has a significant impact on performance, which in turn demonstrates the importance of unveiling the performance characteristics of HBM so as to select the best approach. As a yardstick, we also apply Shuhai to DDR4 to show the differences between HBM and DDR4. Shuhai can be easily generalized to other FPGA boards or other generations of memory, e.g., HBM3, and DDR3. We will make Shuhai open-source, benefiting the community.

    While there have been many studies on hardware acceleration for deep learning on images, there has been a rather limited focus on accelerating deep learning applications involving graphs. The unique characteristics of graphs, such as the irregular memory access and dynamic parallelism, impose several challenges when the algorithm is mapped to a CPU or GPU. To address these challenges while exploiting all the available sparsity, we propose a flexible architecture called StreamGCN for accelerating Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), the core computation unit in deep learning algorithms on graphs. The architecture is specialized for streaming processing of many small graphs for graph search and similarity computation. The experimental results demonstrate that StreamGCN can deliver a high speedup compared to a multi-core CPU and a GPU implementation, showing the efficiency of our design.

  abstract: |
    The emergence of high-bandwidth memory (HBM) brings new opportunities to boost the performance of sorting acceleration on FPGAs, which was conventionally bounded by the available off-chip memory bandwidth. However, it is nontrivial for designers to fully utilize this immense bandwidth. First, the existing sorter designs cannot be directly scaled at the increasing rate of available off-chip bandwidth, as the required on-chip resource usage grows at a much faster rate and would bound the sorting performance in turn. Second, designers need an in-depth understanding of HBM's characteristics to effectively utilize the HBM bandwidth. To tackle these challenges, we present TopSort, a novel two-phase sorting solution optimized for HBM-based FPGAs. In the first phase, 16 merge trees work in parallel to fully utilize 32 HBM channels’ bandwidth. In the second phase, TopSort reuses the logic from phase one to form a wider merge tree to merge the partially sorted results from phase one. TopSort also adopts HBM-specific optimizations to reduce resource overhead and improve bandwidth utilization. TopSort can sort up to 4 GB data using all 32 HBM channels, with an overall sorting performance of 15.6 GB/s. TopSort is 6.7× and 2.7× faster than state-of-the-art CPU and FPGA sorters.
