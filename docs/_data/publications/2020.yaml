    To what extent do traditional OS abstractions make sense in the context of an FPGA as part of a hybrid system? This paper introduces Coyote which supports secure spatial and temporal multiplexing of the FPGA between tenants, virtual memory, communication, and memory management inside a uniform execution environment.
