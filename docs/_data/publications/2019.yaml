  abstract: |
    Open-source automated tool chain called Cloud-DNN. Our tool chain takes trained CNN models specified in Caffe as input, performs a set of transformations, and maps the model to a cloud-based FPGA. Cloud-DNN can significantly improve the overall design productivity of CNNs on FPGAs while satisfying the emergent computational requirements.
