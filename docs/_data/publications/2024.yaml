    The computer architecture landscape is being reshaped by the new opportunities, challenges, and constraints brought by the cloud. On the one hand, high-level applications profit from specialised hardware to boost their performance and reduce deployment costs. On the other hand, cloud providers maximise the CPU time allocated to client applications by offloading infrastructure tasks to hardware accelerators. While it is well understood how to do this for, e.g., network function virtualisation and protocols such as TCP/IP, support for higher networking layers is still largely missing, limiting the potential of accelerators. In this article, we present Strega, an open source1 light-weight Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) server that enables crucial functionality such as FPGA-accelerated functions being called through a RESTful protocol (FPGA-as-a-Function). Our experimental analysis shows that a single Strega node sustains a throughput of 1.7 M HTTP requests per second with an end-to-end latency as low as 16, μs, outperforming nginx running on 32 vCPUs in both metrics, and can even be an alternative to the traditional OpenCL flow over the PCIe bus. Through this work, we pave the way for running microservices directly on FPGAs, bypassing CPU overhead and realising the full potential of FPGA acceleration in distributed cloud applications.

    The multiplication of a sparse matrix with a dense vector is a vital operation in linear algebra, with applications in numerous contexts. After earlier research on FPGA acceleration of this operation had shown the potential to achieve a high bandwidth efficiency, this workload has received renewed attention with the introduction of high bandwidth memory on FPGA platforms. However, previous designs fell short of scaling to the full bandwidth potential of current FPGA platforms with high bandwidth memory. In this work, we present HiHiSpMV with a novel design approach around hierarchical accumulation, which allows us to overcome several limitations of the related work. Our design is completely implemented with high-level synthesis and compiled with Vitis, and instantiates 16 independent compute units, each processing up to 16 matrix elements per clock cycle. The reduction of these elements is performed without any latency or resource overhead and the subsequent accumulation uses the well-established shift-register design pattern. Due to the independent nature of compute units, our design can connect to all of the 32 high bandwidth memory pseudo-channels in 512-bit interface mode on an Alveo U280 FPGA board. In our tests, we reach up to 86% of the theoretical available bandwidth of this FPGA platform, enabling a computational throughput of up to 98 GFLOPS. This is about 1.5x faster than the peak throughput of the best related work in that regard, Serpens. On average, the throughput of HiHiSpMV is even 2.7x higher than Serpens.

    Over the past decade, much progress has been made to advance the acceleration of sparse linear operators such as SpMM and SpMV on FPGAs. Nevertheless, few works have attempted to address sparse triangular solver (SpTRSV) acceleration, and the performance boost is limited. SpTRSV is an elementary linear operator for many numerical methods, such as the least-square method. These methods, among others, are widely used in various areas, such as physical simulation and signal processing. Therefore, accelerating SpTRSV is crucial. However, many challenges impede accelerating SpTRSV, including (1) resolving dependencies between elements during forward or backward substitutions, (2) random access and unbalanced workloads across memory channels due to sparsity, (3) latency incurred by off-chip memory access for large matrices or vectors, and (4) data reuse for an unpredictable data sharing pattern. To address these issues, we have designed LevelST, the first FPGA accelerator leveraging high bandwidth memory (HBM) for solving sparse triangular systems. LevelST features (1) algorithm-hardware co-design of stream-based dependency resolution with reduced off-chip data movement, (2) resource sharing that improves resource utilization to scale up the architecture, (3) index modulo scheduling to balance workload, and (4) selective data prefetching from off-chip memory. LevelST is prototyped on an AMD Xilinx U280 HBM FPGA and evaluated with 16 sparse triangular matrices. Compared with the NVIDIA V100 and RTX 3060 GPUs over the cuSPARSE library, LevelST achieves a 2.65x speedup and 9.82x higher energy efficiency than the best of the V100 GPU and RTX 3060 GPU.

    Noctua 2 is a supercomputer operated at the Paderborn Center for Parallel Computing (PC2) at Paderborn University in Germany. Noctua 2 was inaugurated in 2022 and is an Atos BullSequana XH2000 system. It consists mainly of three node types: 1) CPU Compute nodes with AMD EPYC processors in different main memory configurations, 2) GPU nodes with NVIDIA A100 GPUs, and 3) FPGA nodes with Xilinx Alveo U280 and Intel Stratix 10 FPGA cards. While CPUs and GPUs are known off-the-shelf components in HPC systems, the operation of a large number of FPGA cards from different vendors and a dedicated FPGA-to-FPGA network are unique characteristics of Noctua 2. This paper describes in detail the overall setup of Noctua 2 and gives insights into the operation of the cluster from a hardware, software and facility perspective.

  abstract: |
    Most FPGA boards in the HPC domain are well-suited for parallel scaling because of the direct integration of versatile and high-throughput network ports. However, the utilization of their network capabilities is often challenging and error-prone because the whole network stack and communication patterns have to be implemented and managed on the FPGAs. Also, this approach conceptually involves a trade-off between the performance potential of improved communication and the impact of resource consumption for communication infrastructure, since the utilized resources on the FPGAs could otherwise be used for computations. In this work, we investigate this trade-off, firstly, by using synthetic benchmarks to evaluate the different configuration options of the communication framework ACCL and their impact on communication latency and throughput. Finally, we use our findings to implement a shallow water simulation whose scalability heavily depends on low-latency communication. With a suitable configuration of ACCL, good scaling behavior can be shown to all 48 FPGAs installed in the system. Overall, the results show that the availability of inter-FPGA communication frameworks as well as the configurability of framework and network stack are crucial to achieve the best application performance with low latency communication.

    With the increase in the computation intensity of the chip, the mismatch between computation layer shapes and the available computation resource significantly limits the utilization of the chip. Driven by this observation, prior works discuss spatial accelerators or dataflow architecture to maximize the throughput. However, using spatial accelerators could potentially increase the execution latency. In this work, we first systematically investigate two execution models: (1) sequentially (temporally) launch one monolithic accelerator, and (2) spatially launch multiple accelerators. From the observations, we find that there is a latency throughput tradeoff between these two execution models, and combining these two strategies together can give us a more efficient latency throughput Pareto front. To achieve this, we propose spatial sequential architecture (SSR) and SSR design automation framework to explore both strategies together when deploying deep learning inference. We use the 7nm AMD Versal ACAP VCK190 board to implement SSR accelerators for four end-to-end transformer-based deep learning models. SSR achieves average throughput gains of 2.53x, 35.71x, and 14.20x under different batch sizes compared to the 8nm Nvidia GPU A10G, 16nm AMD FPGAs ZCU102, and U250. The average energy efficiency gains are 8.51x, 6.75x, and 21.22x, respectively. Compared with the sequential-only solution and spatial-only solution on VCK190, our spatial-sequential-hybrid solutions achieve higher throughput under the same latency requirement and lower latency under the same throughput requirement. We also use SSR analytical models to demonstrate how to use SSR to optimize solutions on other computing platforms, e.g., 14nm Intel Stratix 10 NX.

  abstract: |
    Efficiently supporting long context length is crucial for Transformer models. The quadratic complexity of the self-attention computation plagues traditional Transformers. Sliding window-based static sparse attention mitigates the problem by limiting the attention scope of the input tokens, reducing the theoretical complexity from quadratic to linear. Although the sparsity induced by window attention is highly structured, it does not align perfectly with the microarchitecture of the conventional accelerators, leading to suboptimal implementation. In response, we propose a dataflow-aware FPGA-based accelerator design, SWAT, that efficiently leverages the sparsity to achieve scalable performance for long input. The proposed microarchitecture is based on a design that maximizes data reuse by using a combination of row-wise dataflow, kernel fusion optimization, and an input-stationary design considering the distributed memory and computation resources of FPGA. Consequently, it achieves up to 22x and 5.7x improvement in latency and energy efficiency compared to the baseline FPGA-based accelerator and 15x energy efficiency compared to GPU-based solution.

    Despite the increasing adoption of FPGAs in compute clouds, there remains a significant gap in programming tools and abstractions which can leverage network-connected, cloud-scale, multi-die FPGAs to generate accelerators with high frequency and throughput. We propose TAPA-CS, a taskparallel dataflow programming framework which automatically partitions and compiles a large design across a cluster of FPGAs while achieving high frequency and throughput. TAPA-CS has three main contributions. First, it is an open-source framework which allows users to leverage virtually "unlimited" accelerator fabric, high-bandwidth memory (HBM), and on-chip memory. Second, given as input a large design, TAPA-CS automatically partitions the design to map to multiple FPGAs, while ensuring congestion control, resource balancing, and overlapping of communication and computation. Third, TAPA-CS couples coarse-grained floorplanning with interconnect pipelining at the inter- and intraFPGA levels to ensure high frequency. FPGAs in our multiFPGA testbed communicate through a high-speed 100Gbps Ethernet infrastructure. We have evaluated the performance of TAPA-CS on designs, including systolic-array based CNNs, graph processing workloads such as page rank, stencil applications, and KNN. On average, the 2-, 3-, and 4-FPGA designs are 2.1×, 3.2×, and 4.4× faster than the single FPGA baselines generated through Vitis HLS. TAPA-CS also achieves a frequency improvement between 11%-116% compared with Vitis HLS.
