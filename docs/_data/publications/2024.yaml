    "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been used to solve complex problems of drug discovery, social media analysis, etc. Meanwhile, GPUs are becoming dominating accelerators to improve deep neural network performance. However, due to the characteristics of graph data, it is challenging to accelerate GNN-type workloads with GPUs alone. GraphSAGE is one representative GNN workload that uses sampling to improve GNN learning efficiency. Profiling the GraphSAGE using PyG library reveals that the sampling stage on the CPU is the bottleneck. Hence, we propose a heterogeneous system architecture solution with the sampling algorithm accelerated on customizable accelerators (FPGA), and feed sampled data into GPU training through a PCIe Peer-to-Peer (P2P) communication flow. With FPGA acceleration, for the sampling stage alone, we achieve a speed-up of 2.38× to 8.55× compared with sampling on CPU. For end-to-end latency, compared with the traditional flow, we achieve a speed-up of 1.24× to 1.99 ×"

    "FPGAs are increasingly prevalent in cloud deployments, serving as SmartNICs or network-attached accelerators. To facilitate the development of distributed applications with FPGAs, in this paper we propose ACCL+, an open-source, FPGA-based collective communication library. Portable across different platforms and supporting UDP, TCP, as well as RDMA, ACCL+ empowers FPGA applications to initiate direct FPGA-to-FPGA collective communication. Additionally, it can serve as a collective offload engine for CPU applications, freeing the CPU from networking tasks. It is user-extensible, allowing new collectives to be implemented and deployed without having to re-synthesize the entire design. We evaluated ACCL+ on an FPGA cluster with 100 Gb/s networking, comparing its performance against software MPI over RDMA. The results demonstrate ACCL+'s significant advantages for FPGA-based distributed applications and its competitive performance for CPU applications. We showcase ACCL+'s dual role with two use cases: as a collective offload engine to distribute CPU-based vector-matrix multiplication, and as a component in designing fully FPGA-based distributed deep-learning recommendation inference"

    "The computer architecture landscape is being reshaped by the new opportunities, challenges, and constraints brought by the cloud. On the one hand, high-level applications profit from specialised hardware to boost their performance and reduce deployment costs. On the other hand, cloud providers maximise the CPU time allocated to client applications by offloading infrastructure tasks to hardware accelerators. While it is well understood how to do this for, e.g., network function virtualisation and protocols such as TCP/IP, support for higher networking layers is still largely missing, limiting the potential of accelerators. In this article, we present Strega, an open source1 light-weight Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) server that enables crucial functionality such as FPGA-accelerated functions being called through a RESTful protocol (FPGA-as-a-Function). Our experimental analysis shows that a single Strega node sustains a throughput of 1.7 M HTTP requests per second with an end-to-end latency as low as 16, μs, outperforming nginx running on 32 vCPUs in both metrics, and can even be an alternative to the traditional OpenCL flow over the PCIe bus. Through this work, we pave the way for running microservices directly on FPGAs, bypassing CPU overhead and realising the full potential of FPGA acceleration in distributed cloud applications"

    "The Bloom filter is one of the most widely used data structures in big data analytics to efficiently filter out vast amounts of noisy data. Unfortunately, prior Bloom filter designs only focus on single-input-stream acceleration, and can no longer match the increasing data rates offered by modern networks. To support large Bloom filters with low false-positive rate and high throughput, we present BitBlender, a configurable and scalable multi-input-stream Bloom filter acceleration framework in HLS. To effectively share one large bit-vector on chip among all streams, we design and implement the novel arbiter and unshuffle modules to dynamically schedule conflicting accesses to execute sequentially and non-conflicting accesses to execute in parallel. To support different user configurations of the Bloom filter, we also develop an automation flow, together with an accurate performance estimator, to automatically generate the best BitBlender design. Experimental results show that, on the AMD/Xilinx Alveo U280 FPGA, BitBlender achieves a throughput up to 2,194 MQueries/s (i.e., 8.8 GB/s) for a 96Mb bit-vector with 0.01% false-positive rate. It achieves up to 10.4x speedup over a 24-thread CPU implementation and up to 4.9x speedup over a naively-duplicated multi-stream FPGA design"

    "Federated Learning (FL) is an evolving paradigm that enables multiple parties to collaboratively train models without sharing raw data. Among its variants, Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) is particularly relevant in real-world, cross-organizational collaborations, where distinct features of a shared instance group are contributed by different parties. In these scenarios, parties are often linked using fuzzy identifiers, leading to a common practice termed as multi-party fuzzy VFL. Existing models generally address either multi-party VFL or fuzzy VFL between two parties. Extending these models to practical multi-party fuzzy VFL typically results in significant performance degradation and increased costs for maintaining privacy. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Federated Transformer (FeT), a novel framework that supports multi-party VFL with fuzzy identifiers. FeT innovatively encodes these identifiers into data representations and employs a transformer architecture distributed across different parties, incorporating three new techniques to enhance performance. Furthermore, we have developed a multi-party privacy framework for VFL that integrates differential privacy with secure multi-party computation, effectively protecting local representations while minimizing associated utility costs. Our experiments demonstrate that the FeT surpasses the baseline models by up to 46% in terms of accuracy when scaled to 50 parties. Additionally, in two-party fuzzy VFL settings, FeT also shows improved performance and privacy over cutting-edge VFL modelstings"

    "Shared Virtual Memory (SVM) is a mechanism that allows host-side applications and FPGA accelerators to access the same virtual address space. It enables accelerating algorithms with unpredictable memory access patterns by making transparent pointer sharing possible. Even for applications with predictable memory access patterns, SVM helps by eliminating manual data movement. FlexiMem is a customizable SVM system that uses FPGA-addressable memory resources to store virtual memory pages, rather than directly accessing the host memory, to achieve high throughput and low latency. On the FPGA side, FlexiMem features a highly-flexible interconnect that, for the first time, allows for configuring address and payload data paths independently for SVM systems. It supports multiple master and slave devices sharing the same address space, such as accelerators issuing many memory requests in parallel to multiple memory banks. With our interconnect design, we provide numerous specialization dimensions to optimize the SVM system for a given workload. For example, irregular applications with short accesses to memory require an address translation for each data transfer. Such applications can take advantage of a highly parallelized address data path and an increased number of TLBs working in parallel. In contrast, regular and bursting applications transfer a small number of address packets per many data packets, and they can tolerate a lightweight address data path with a single translation unit. FlexiMem also provides address translation units with reconfigurable capacities and page sizes to be tailored to the needs of the application. On the host side, FlexiMem leverages the Linux userfaultfd API and vendor-provided IPs and drivers for automatic data movement initiated by software. Blocks of memory allocated by the FlexiMem API can be passed freely to the FPGA or other host-side libraries, without requiring any kind of explicit data movement. We evaluate several experimental setups with various FlexiMem configurations to showcase the effect of customizability on performanc"

  abstract: |
    "A typical SmartNIC (SNIC) integrates a processor comprising Arm CPU and accelerators with a conventional NIC. The processor is designed to energy-efficiently execute network functions frequently used by datacenter applications. With such a processor, the SNIC has promised to notably improve the system-wide energy efficiency of datacenter servers. Nevertheless, the latest trend of integrating accelerators into server CPUs for these functions sparks a question on the SNIC processor’s superiority over a host processor (i.e., server CPU with accelerators) in system-wide energy efficiency, especially under given tail latency constraints. Answering this question, we first take an Intel Xeon processor, integrated with various accelerators (e.g., QuickAssist Technology), as a host processor, and then compare it to an NVIDIA BlueField-2 SNIC processor. This uncovers that (1) the host accelerator, coupled with a more powerful memory subsystem, can outperform the SNIC accelerator, and (2) the SNIC processor can improve system-wide energy efficiency only at low packet rates for most functions under tail latency constraints. To provide high system-wide energy efficiency without compromising tail latency at any packet rates, we propose HAL, consisting of a hardware-based load balancer and an intelligent load balancing policy implemented inside the SNIC. When HAL determines that the SNIC processor cannot efficiently process a given function beyond a specific packet rate, it limits the rate of packets to the SNIC processor and lets the host processor handle the excess. We implement a HAL-enabled SNIC with a commodity FPGA and a BlueField-2 SNIC, plug it into a commodity server, and run 10 popular network functions. Our evaluation shows that HAL can improve the system-wide energy efficiency and throughput of the server running these functions by 31% and 10%, respectively, without notably increasing the tail latency"

    "Large-scale graph processing poses challenges due to its size and irregular memory access patterns, causing performance degradation in common architectures, such as CPUs and GPUs. Recent research includes accelerating graph processing using Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). FPGAs can provide very efficient acceleration thanks to reconfigurable on-chip resources. Although limited, these resources offer a larger design space than CPUs and GPUs. We propose an approach in which data are preprocessed in small chunks with an optimized graph partitioning technique for execution on FPGA accelerators. The chunks, located on the host, are streamed directly into a customized memory layer implemented in the FPGA, which is tightly coupled with the processing elements responsible for the graph algorithm execution. This improves application memory access latency, which is crucial in large-sale graph computing performance. This work presents a hardware design that, combined with graph partitioning, enables us to achieve high-performance and potentially scalable handling of large graphs (i.e., graphs with millions of vertices and billions of edges in current scenarios) while using popular graph algorithms. The proposed framework accelerates performance 56 times compared with CPU (multicore with 16 logical cores in our reference experiments), 2.5 times and 4 times faster compared to state-of-the-art FPGA and GPU solutions (FPGA has 15 compute units, and GPU reference has 128 streaming-multiprocessors in our experiments), respectively, when using the PageRank algorithm. For the Single-Source-Shortest-Past (SSSP) algorithm, we achieve speedups of up to 65x, 26x, and 18x compared to CPU, GPU, and FPGA works, respectively. Lastly, in the context of the Weakly Connected Component (WCC) algorithm, our framework achieves a speedup of up to 403 times compared to the CPU, 7.4x against the GPU, and it is faster than the FPGA alternatives up to 10.3x."

    "Dataflow architectures are growing in popularity due to their potential to mitigate the challenges posed by the memory wall inherent to the Von Neumann architecture. At the same time, high-level synthesis (HLS) has demonstrated its efficacy as a design methodology for generating efficient dataflow architectures within a short development cycle. However, existing HLS tools rely on developers to explore the vast dataflow design space, ultimately leading to suboptimal designs. This phenomenon is especially concerning as the size of the HLS design grows. To tackle these challenges, we introduce HIDA1, a new scalable and hierarchical HLS framework that can systematically convert an algorithmic description into a dataflow implementation on hardware. We first propose a collection of efficient and versatile dataflow representations for modeling the hierarchical dataflow structure. Capitalizing on these representations, we develop an automated optimizer that decomposes the dataflow optimization problem into multiple levels based on the inherent dataflow hierarchy. Using FPGAs as an evaluation platform, working with a set of neural networks modeled in PyTorch, HIDA achieves up to 8.54× higher throughput compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) HLS optimization tool. Furthermore, despite being fully automated and able to handle various applications, HIDA achieves 1.29× higher throughput over the SOTA RTL-based neural network accelerators on an FPGA"

    "The multiplication of a sparse matrix with a dense vector is a vital operation in linear algebra, with applications in numerous contexts. After earlier research on FPGA acceleration of this operation had shown the potential to achieve a high bandwidth efficiency, this workload has received renewed attention with the introduction of high bandwidth memory on FPGA platforms. However, previous designs fell short of scaling to the full bandwidth potential of current FPGA platforms with high bandwidth memory. In this work, we present HiHiSpMV with a novel design approach around hierarchical accumulation, which allows us to overcome several limitations of the related work. Our design is completely implemented with high-level synthesis and compiled with Vitis, and instantiates 16 independent compute units, each processing up to 16 matrix elements per clock cycle. The reduction of these elements is performed without any latency or resource overhead and the subsequent accumulation uses the well-established shift-register design pattern. Due to the independent nature of compute units, our design can connect to all of the 32 high bandwidth memory pseudo-channels in 512-bit interface mode on an Alveo U280 FPGA board. In our tests, we reach up to 86% of the theoretical available bandwidth of this FPGA platform, enabling a computational throughput of up to 98 GFLOPS. This is about 1.5x faster than the peak throughput of the best related work in that regard, Serpens. On average, the throughput of HiHiSpMV is even 2.7x higher than Serpens"

    "Designing high-performance scientific applications has become a time-consuming and complex task that requires developers to master multiple frameworks and toolchains. Although re-configurability and energy efficiency make FPGA a powerful accelerator, efficiently integrating multiple FPGAs into a distributed cluster is a complex and cumbersome task. Such complexity grows considerably when applications require partitioning execution among CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs. This paper introduces FPGA offloading support to OpenMP cluster (OMPC), an OpenMP-only framework capable of transparently offloading computation across nodes in a cluster, which reduces developer effort and time to solution. In addition, OMPC enables true heterogeneity by allowing the programmer to assign program kernels to the most appropriate architecture (CPUs, GPUs, or FPGA), depending on their workload characteristics. This is achieved by adding only a few lines of standard OpenMP code to the application. The resulting framework was applied to the heterogeneous acceleration of an image recoloring application. Experimental results demonstrate speed-ups gains using different acceleration arrangements with CPU, GPU and FPGA. Measurements using Halstead metrics show that the proposed framework is faster to program. Furthermore, the solution enables transparently offloading OMPC communication tasks to multiple FPGAs, which results in speed-ups of up to 1.41x over the default communication mechanism (Message Passing Interface - MPI) on Task Bench, a synthetic benchmark for task parallelism"

    "Over the past decade, much progress has been made to advance the acceleration of sparse linear operators such as SpMM and SpMV on FPGAs. Nevertheless, few works have attempted to address sparse triangular solver (SpTRSV) acceleration, and the performance boost is limited. SpTRSV is an elementary linear operator for many numerical methods, such as the least-square method. These methods, among others, are widely used in various areas, such as physical simulation and signal processing. Therefore, accelerating SpTRSV is crucial. However, many challenges impede accelerating SpTRSV, including (1) resolving dependencies between elements during forward or backward substitutions, (2) random access and unbalanced workloads across memory channels due to sparsity, (3) latency incurred by off-chip memory access for large matrices or vectors, and (4) data reuse for an unpredictable data sharing pattern. To address these issues, we have designed LevelST, the first FPGA accelerator leveraging high bandwidth memory (HBM) for solving sparse triangular systems. LevelST features (1) algorithm-hardware co-design of stream-based dependency resolution with reduced off-chip data movement, (2) resource sharing that improves resource utilization to scale up the architecture, (3) index modulo scheduling to balance workload, and (4) selective data prefetching from off-chip memory. LevelST is prototyped on an AMD Xilinx U280 HBM FPGA and evaluated with 16 sparse triangular matrices. Compared with the NVIDIA V100 and RTX 3060 GPUs over the cuSPARSE library, LevelST achieves a 2.65x speedup and 9.82x higher energy efficiency than the best of the V100 GPU and RTX 3060 GPU"

    "Most FPGA boards in the HPC domain are well-suited for parallel scaling because of the direct integration of versatile and high-throughput network ports. However, the utilization of their network capabilities is often challenging and error-prone because the whole network stack and communication patterns have to be implemented and managed on the FPGAs. Also, this approach conceptually involves a trade-off between the performance potential of improved communication and the impact of resource consumption for communication infrastructure, since the utilized resources on the FPGAs could otherwise be used for computations. In this work, we investigate this trade-off, firstly, by using synthetic benchmarks to evaluate the different configuration options of the communication framework ACCL and their impact on communication latency and throughput. Finally, we use our findings to implement a shallow water simulation whose scalability heavily depends on low-latency communication. With a suitable configuration of ACCL, good scaling behavior can be shown to all 48 FPGAs installed in the system. Overall, the results show that the availability of inter-FPGA communication frameworks as well as the configurability of framework and network stack are crucial to achieve the best application performance with low latency communication"

    "In recent years, Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) have gained prominence in cloud computing data centers, driven by their capacity to offload compute-intensive tasks and contribute to the ongoing trend of data center disaggregation, as well as their ability to be directly connected to the network. While FPGAs offer numerous advantages, they also pose challenges in terms of configuration, programmability, and monitoring, particularly in the absence of an operating system with essential features like the TCP/IP networking stack. This paper introduces an In-band Network Telemetry (INT) approach based on the P4 language for FPGA data plane programming. The goal is to facilitate monitoring and network performance analysis by providing one-way packet delay information. The approach is demonstrated in the Open Cloud Testbed (OCT) and FABRIC testbeds, both offering open access to the research community with greater FPGA availability than commercial clouds. The workflow enables researchers to create custom P4 programs and bitstreams for installation on FPGAs. The paper presents a multi-step approach allowing experimentation within the New England Research Cloud (NERC), testing in OCT, and final deployment in FABRIC, well-suited for one-way delay measurements due to synchronized clocks via GPS time signals.

The intensive computation and bandwidth demand for ERI evaluation presents a significant challenge for quantum-mechanics-based atomistic simulations with hybrid density functional theory: due to the tens of trillions of ERI computations in each time step, practical applications are usually limited to thousands of atoms. In this work, we propose SERI, a high-throughput streaming accelerator for ERI computation on HBM-based FPGAs. In contrast to prior buffer-based designs, SERI proposes a novel streaming architecture to address the on-chip buffer limitation and the floorplanning challenge, and leverages the high-bandwidth memory to overcome the bandwidth bottleneck in prior designs. Moreover, to meet the varying computation, bandwidth, and floorplanning requirements between the 55 canonical quartet classes in ERI calculation, we design an automation tool, together with an accurate performance model, to automatically customize the architecture and floorplanning strategy for each canonical quartet class to maximize their throughput. Our performance evaluation on the AMD Alveo U280 FPGA board shows that, SERI achieves an average speedup of 9.80x over the previous best-performing FPGA design, a 3.21x speedup over a 64-core AMD EPYC 7713 CPU, and a 15.64x speedup over an Nvidia A40 GPU.

Driven by this observation, prior works discuss spatial accelerators or dataflow architecture to maximize the throughput. However, using spatial accelerators could potentially increase the execution latency. In this work, we first systematically investigate two execution models: (1) sequentially (temporally) launch one monolithic accelerator, and (2) spatially launch multiple accelerators. From the observations, we find that there is a latency throughput tradeoff between these two execution models, and combining these two strategies together can give us a more efficient latency throughput Pareto front. To achieve this, we propose spatial sequential architecture (SSR) and SSR design automation framework to explore both strategies together when deploying deep learning inference. We use the 7nm AMD Versal ACAP VCK190 board to implement SSR accelerators for four end-to-end transformer-based deep learning models. SSR achieves average throughput gains of 2.53x, 35.71x, and 14.20x under different batch sizes compared to the 8nm Nvidia GPU A10G, 16nm AMD FPGAs ZCU102, and U250. The average energy efficiency gains are 8.51x, 6.75x, and 21.22x, respectively. Compared with the sequential-only solution and spatial-only solution on VCK190, our spatial-sequential-hybrid solutions achieve higher throughput under the same latency requirement and lower latency under the same throughput requirement. We also use SSR analytical models to demonstrate how to use SSR to optimize solutions on other computing platforms, e.g., 14nm Intel Stratix 10 NX"

    "Efficiently supporting long context length is crucial for Transformer models. The quadratic complexity of the self-attention computation plagues traditional Transformers. Sliding window-based static sparse attention mitigates the problem by limiting the attention scope of the input tokens, reducing the theoretical complexity from quadratic to linear. Although the sparsity induced by window attention is highly structured, it does not align perfectly with the microarchitecture of the conventional accelerators, leading to suboptimal implementation. In response, we propose a dataflow-aware FPGA-based accelerator design, SWAT, that efficiently leverages the sparsity to achieve scalable performance for long input. The proposed microarchitecture is based on a design that maximizes data reuse by using a combination of row-wise dataflow, kernel fusion optimization, and an input-stationary design considering the distributed memory and computation resources of FPGA. Consequently, it achieves up to 22x and 5.7x improvement in latency and energy efficiency compared to the baseline FPGA-based accelerator and 15x energy efficiency compared to GPU-based solution"

    "Despite the increasing adoption of FPGAs in compute clouds, there remains a significant gap in programming tools and abstractions which can leverage network-connected, cloud-scale, multi-die FPGAs to generate accelerators with high frequency and throughput. We propose TAPA-CS, a taskparallel dataflow programming framework which automatically partitions and compiles a large design across a cluster of FPGAs while achieving high frequency and throughput. TAPA-CS has three main contributions. First, it is an open-source framework which allows users to leverage virtually "unlimited" accelerator fabric, high-bandwidth memory (HBM), and on-chip memory. Second, given as input a large design, TAPA-CS automatically partitions the design to map to multiple FPGAs, while ensuring congestion control, resource balancing, and overlapping of communication and computation. Third, TAPA-CS couples coarse-grained floorplanning with interconnect pipelining at the inter- and intraFPGA levels to ensure high frequency. FPGAs in our multiFPGA testbed communicate through a high-speed 100Gbps Ethernet infrastructure. We have evaluated the performance of TAPA-CS on designs, including systolic-array based CNNs, graph processing workloads such as page rank, stencil applications, and KNN. On average, the 2-, 3-, and 4-FPGA designs are 2.1×, 3.2×, and 4.4× faster than the single FPGA baselines generated through Vitis HLS. TAPA-CS also achieves a frequency improvement between 11%-116% compared with Vitis HLS"

    "Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) is a crucial paradigm for training machine learning models on feature-partitioned, distributed data. However, due to privacy restrictions, few public real-world VFL datasets exist for algorithm evaluation, and these represent a limited array of feature distributions. Existing benchmarks often resort to synthetic datasets, derived from arbitrary feature splits from a global set, which only capture a subset of feature distributions, leading to inadequate algorithm performance assessment. This paper addresses these shortcomings by introducing two key factors affecting VFL performance - feature importance and feature correlation - and proposing associated evaluation metrics and dataset splitting methods. Additionally, we introduce a real VFL dataset to address the deficit in image-image VFL scenarios. Our comprehensive evaluation of cutting-edge VFL algorithms provides valuable insights for future research in the field"
