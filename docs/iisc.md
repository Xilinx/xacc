# Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore

IISc, Bangalore, is a premier institute in India which has very strong Electrical, Electronics and Computer Science Departments
doing research in the areas of architecture, systems software and software optimizations. AMD has partnered with IISc and
created a HACC center in the department of Computer Science and Automation (CSA). The interactions are led by
[Prof. Ramaswamy Govindarajan](https://eecs.iisc.ac.in/people/govindarajan-r/)
and [Prof. Chiranjib Bhattacharya](https://eecs.iisc.ac.in/people/chiranjib-bhattacharyya/) (both Professors in the Department of CSA).
